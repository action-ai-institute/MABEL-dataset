# MABEL: [M]alware [A]nalysis [Be]nchmark for Artificial Intelligence and Machine [L]earning

Welcome to the MABEL malware analysis dataset release for machine learning and AI modeling. 

This is our initial dataset release. There are multiple file segments in our initial dataset. These files should be appended (concatenated) to form a single dataset.  Our first release contains analysis from our framework specific to 400+ malware families and binaries associated to each malware family.  

The data in these segments pertain to the complete analysis from our framework that we can represent as attributes regarding each analyzed binary. 

NOTE: (There are additional attributes describing each binary.  We plan to release all features in our database regarding these samples.)



#### Special thanks to vx-underground.org for providing the samples and malware family attribution in our dataset release.
