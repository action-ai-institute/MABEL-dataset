# MABEL: [M]alware [A]nalysis [Be]nchmark for Artificial Intelligence and Machine [L]earning

## Description
This dataset is an abbreviation of our initial full static binary analysis dataset specified at [MABEL Full Dataset](https://github.com/action-ai-institute/MABEL-dataset/tree/main/release/malware_family/2024-06-20-0530).
This dataset contains analysis of Windows 32-bit PE binary files associated to a malware family.  

## Contents
This release contains analysis from our framework specific to 400+ malware families and binaries associated to each malware family.  
The instances in this single dataset have been cleaned and all hex values have been converted to decimal.
This dataset is ready to be analyzed via Machine Learning models. 


#### Special thanks to vx-underground.org for providing the samples and malware family attribution in our dataset release.
